CODECOACH DESCRIPTION
CodeCoach is a Rails-based web app that allows software engineers to sign up and match with a student who is looking to learn to code. Coaches can add open source materials to create a custom curriculum for their student, and get them started on their coding journey.

INSTALL AND USAGE INSTRUCTIONS
To use CodeCoach, fork and clone the repository. CD to the local repository files, run bundle install, then run rails db:migrate. Once this has completed run rails s from the terminal. In your web browser, navigate to the appropriate localhost, and sign up to either be a coach or a student. If you are signing up as a coach, your profile will appear to new students who are looking for someone to coach them. If you sign up as a student, navigate to Find a Coach to pick your coach.
